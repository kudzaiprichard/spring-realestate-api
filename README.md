<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

### Project Scope

The real estate marketplace works as a mediator between homeowners and buyers/renters. Property owners can list their estate on the site,
set the approximate price, and find the customers. Customers, on the other hand, can search for a place, check property photos, building plans, and overall descriptions.

* Real estate agents can create accounts and advertise and sell there property
* Customer can view listed estates and can filter through this list of estate
* Customer must then be able to contact estate agent through that particular advert

## Project Design

### Architecture
System uses REST API Architecture. REST stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a popular architectural 
style for designing networked applications. It allows different software systems to communicate with each other by 
exchanging data over the internet, typically using the HTTP protocol.

This will architecture is scalable, flexible and lightweight and allows for other third party software, mobile, web written
in different languages to easily integrate with our services

### Endpoit Design
Below is a screenshot of the project restful api endpoints and the HTTP Method supported by each endpoint

### UML Diagram
Below is the UML design of the system including relationships between the difference objects that make up the system

The bottom diagram extends the one above and takes precedence in any data conflict

### Built With
Used Java spring boot , MySQL and Jason Web Token to build the rest api, including postman for testing.
